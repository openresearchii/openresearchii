## Open Research India Initiative

> Our goal is to solve social problems and make lives better through research and innovation in technology.

### Open Research Mindset
Reseach should not be limited to only specific institutions. Everyone who thinks of making things better can contribute. Our aim is to make our neighbourhoods better. We start small, and try to bring a change at a local level. We aim to collaborate with local people, communities and social groups and involve them in the process. The objective is to create high quality focused research communities.

### Why India?
India is a diverse country and it becomes our responsibility to uplift everyone. Since every problem is different, it is better to solve the problems at local level while being inspired from each other keeping it under the same umbrella of our nation.
